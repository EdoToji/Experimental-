**CECS 326** is starting out as a fun course!

I would love to see more about the cool things I can do with github

What would help my learning the most in this course is 

-seeing examples and breakdowns of complex topics

-learning more about the computer science industry and how this course can help me become successful in the real world

Professor Giacalone is very fun so far and I enjoy his lectures so far
